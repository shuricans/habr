* Take the directory called "images" from the root of this project (*just pictures inside*)
* Place *docker-compose.yml* and *"images"* in same directory.
> Depending on installed version of docker, commands may be different:  
> `docker-compose` or `docker compose`
* Run `docker compose up -d`
* App ready > navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* View backend API description [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html)
* To stop containers, use `docker compose stop` command.
* To stop and remove - `docker compose down` command.
> You can view logs of running apps via `docker compose logs -f`  
> and containers statistics via `docker stats`

##### 2. Second way - docker & IntelliJ IDEA or your favorite IDE:
* Be sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.
* required versions or mb higher:
    * JDK 11
    * maven 3.8.3
    * [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.17.0
    * npm 8.15.0
    * [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli): 15.0.2
* Clone project from github
* First, in parent module **habr** run `mvn clean install`
  * All tests must pass successfully. I hope :)
* Database. I recommend using ready image
  * docker compose help us (take this [docker-compose.yml](https://gist.github.com/shuricans/0b5c0790d014fdec7815ff1fa0c019fc))
  * Use `docker compose up -d` command for it.
  * If you need another tags, go to [habr-db images](https://hub.docker.com/r/shuricans/habr-db/tags)
> You can stop and remove this container by `docker compose down`
* Navigate to the backend app package `cd backend-api-app/`
  * Use `mvn spring-boot:run` command to run backend (`Ctrl + c` to stop app)
  * Alternatively you can run it from file **BackendApiAppApplication** with IDE.
* Navigate to the picture-service-api-app package `cd picture-service-api-app/`
  * Use `mvn spring-boot:run` command to run picture-service (`Ctrl + c` to stop app)
  * Alternatively you can run it from file **PictureServiceApiAppApplication** with IDE.
* Now let's go and start frontend with [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
  * Navigate to the frontend app package `cd frontend-app/`
  * Run `npm i` - this command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.
  * Run `ng serve` - builds and serves your application, rebuilding on file changes.
* App ready > navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
* View backend API description [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html)
